## Palindrome dates

Today (2020-02-02, at the time of this writing) happens to be a palindrome, without the hyphens, not only for those countries which express their dates in the yyyy-mm-dd format but, unusually, also for countries which use the dd-mm-yyyy format.
Write a program which calculates and shows the next 15 palindromic dates for those countries which express their dates in the yyyy-mm-dd format.
